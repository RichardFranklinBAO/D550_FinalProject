# Cross-Sectional Momentum on S&P 500

This repository contains the data, scripts, and final report for an analysis of a **12-1 cross-sectional momentum strategy** applied to S&P 500 stocks using the "S&P 500 stock data" Kaggle dataset.

The project demonstrates the process of:
1.  Obtaining and cleaning raw stock price data.
2.  Aggregating daily prices to monthly log returns.
3.  Constructing the 12-1 momentum signal (return over $t-12$ to $t-2$, skipping $t-1$).
4.  Forming decile portfolios (Long Q10, Short Q1) and evaluating performance.
5.  Visualizing gross vs. cost-adjusted cumulative returns.

## Repository Contents

* **`Final_Project/`**: The root directory for the project.
    * **`data/`**: Stores data used in the analysis.
        * **`raw/`**: Contains the original, raw data file.
            * `all_stocks_5yr.csv`: The input file with 5 years of daily OHLCV data.
        * **`clean/`**: Stores the cleaned and aggregated data generated by the script.
            * `monthly_returns.csv`: Monthly log returns for all stocks.
    * **`Makefile`**: (Likely) Used to automate the report generation process.
    * **`R_Project.Rmd`**: The R Markdown source file containing all the analysis code.
    * **`R_Project.html`**: The final rendered HTML report.

## Generating the Report

The final report, **`R_Project.html`**, is generated from the R Markdown file **`R_Project.Rmd`**.

### **Prerequisites**

You will need an R environment with the following packages installed: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, `ggplot2`, `PerformanceAnalytics`, `slider`, `readr`, `xts`, and `here`.

### **Steps**

1.  **Open the R Markdown file:** Open `R_Project.Rmd` in RStudio or an R environment.
2.  **Knit the document:** Execute the "Knit" command (or equivalent function in R, such as `rmarkdown::render("R_Project.Rmd")`) to compile the file. This process will:
    * Read the raw data (`all_stocks_5yr.csv`).
    * Perform all data cleaning and momentum calculations.
    * Generate the final table and figure.
    * Output the final report as **`R_Project.html`**.
   
The last two pieces of code chunks generate the tables and figures. 
And where the code for creating your required table is is very clear on the `R_Project.Rmd` file.
And where the code for creating your required figure is is very clear on the `R_Project.Rmd` file.

*(Alternatively, if you have `make` installed, running `make report` in the root directory generates the R_Project.html.)*

## Report Summary

The final report details the methodology and results of the 12-1 momentum strategy. Key findings include:
* A reproducible baseline performance for the **long-short (Q10–Q1) portfolio** over the sample period (March 2014 to February 2018).
* **Performance metrics** (Annualized Return, Volatility, Sharpe Ratio) for the gross portfolio.
* A comparison of **cumulative returns** between the gross and a cost-adjusted (net) portfolio.

## Code Locations

All the analysis code is contained within the **`R_Project.Rmd`** file, structured into R code chunks:

| Analysis Step | R Markdown Chunk Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Acquisition** | `get_data` | Reads the raw `all_stocks_5yr.csv`. |
| **Data Cleaning** | `monthly_returns` | Converts daily prices to monthly log returns and saves the clean data. |
| **Momentum & Portfolios** | `momentum` | Calculates the 12-1 momentum signal, forms decile portfolios, and computes gross and net long-short returns. |
| **Performance Table** | **`table1`** | **Contains the R code to generate the final performance and sample coverage table.** |
| **Cumulative Return Figure** | **`figure`** | **Contains the R code to generate the cumulative return plot (gross vs. net).** |
